--This query selects the names and IDs of students who have applied to engineering at any of the colleges.

select ID, name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering');


--This is an alternate way to to the query right above without using a subquery
select distinct Student_ID, name
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID and major = 'Engineering';



--This query shows the GPA, name, and ID of the students who applied for engineering

select GPA,ID,name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering')


--Alternate way to write the query above without a subquery
select distinct ID,name,GPA
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID and major = 'Engineering';


--This query shows the students who applied to Engineering but not Math. The result is the same as using the except operator in a previous example.

select ID, name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering')
and ID not in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Math')



--This query finds all Colleges such that there is some other College within the same state
select name,state
from College C1
where exists (select * from College C2 where C2.state = C1.state and C1.name <> C2.name);



--This query finds all colleges where there does not exist another college whose enrollment is higher than the first college
-- This is essentially a max function

select name,state
from College C1
where not exists (select * from College C2 where C2.enrollment > C1.enrollment);



--This query finds the student with the highest GPA
select name, GPA
from Student S1
where not exists (select * from Student S2 where S2.GPA > S1.GPA);


--This query does is another way to do the above query. Note that all does not work in SQL lite
select name,GPA
from Student 
where GPA >= all (select GPA from Student);


--This query however will work in SQLlite
select name, GPA
from Student
where GPA >= (select max(GPA) from Student)


--This query gives you all colleges where it is not the case that the enrollment is less than or equal to any other college
select name
from College C1
where not enrollment<= any(select enrollment from College C2 where C2.name<>C1.name);

--This query all of the students who do not have the lowest GPA. We look for students where there is some student with a lower GPA.
select ID,name,GPA
from Student S1
where exists( select * from Student S2 where S1.GPA > S2.GPA);





--This query shows another way to get all students who applied to Engineering but not Math 
select ID,name
from Student 
where  ID = any(select ID from Application where major = 'Engineering')
and not ID = any(select ID from Application where major = 'Math');
