--This query selects the names and IDs of students who have applied to engineering at any of the colleges.

select ID, name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering');


--This is an alternate way to to the query right above without using a subquery
select distinct Student_ID, name
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID and major = 'Engineering';



--This query shows the GPA, name, and ID of the students who applied for engineering

select GPA,ID,name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering')


--Alternate way to write the query above without a subquery
select distinct ID,name,GPA
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID and major = 'Engineering';


--This query shows the students who applied to Engineering but not Math. The result is the same as using the except operator in a previous example.
