--This query selects the names and IDs of students who have applied to engineering at any of the colleges.

select ID, name
from Student
where ID in (select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering');


--This is an alternate way to to the query right above without using a subquery
select distinct Student_ID, name
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID and major = 'Engineering';
