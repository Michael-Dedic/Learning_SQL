-- Note-> Use these 2 intserted rows for the Student Table to perform some queries with Null values

insert into Student values (1130, 'Kevin', null,'Engineering', 1500);
insert into Student values (1131, 'Lori', null, 'Engineering', 2500);

--Notice in how the query below that Kevin and Lori do not show up. 
--This is due to the fact that the NULL GPA does not satisfy either of the consitions even thought the statement query should show everybody.


select ID, name, GPA
from Student
where GPA >3.5 or GPA<= 3.5;


--The above query can show everyone by adding the GPA is null in the where clause

elect ID, name, GPA
from Student
where GPA >3.5 or GPA<= 3.5 or GPA is null;
