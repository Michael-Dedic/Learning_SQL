--This is a query from the querying in SQL using select file but now it is more readable and cleaner
select distinct ID, S.name, College_Name, GPA,major, enrollment
from Student S,College C ,Application A
where A.Student_ID = S.ID and A.College_Name = C.name order by GPA desc, enrollment;


--This query selects which students have the same GPA by making 2 instances of the student data and performing a cross product on them.
select distinct S1.ID, S1.name, S1.GPA, S2.ID, S2.name, S2.GPA
from Student S1,Student S2
where S1.GPA = S2.GPA and S1.ID < S2.ID
--The S1.ID < S2.ID makes it so that the each person does not get matched with themselves since there are 2 Student instances and each unique pair is only shown once in the result.

--This query selects names from both student and college tables
select name as Name from Student

union all

select name as Name from College
order by Name;

--This shows the student IDs of those who applied to engineering and math

select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Engineering'

intersect

select Student_ID from Application where major = 'Math'
