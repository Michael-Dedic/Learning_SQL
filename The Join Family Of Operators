--Previous code that uses a natural join that matches students names and their applications majors.

Select distinct name, major
from Student, Application
where Student.ID = Application.Student_ID;



--This code does the same as above except it uses the inner join(cross product) and then checks the condition.
Select distinct name, major
from Student inner join Application
on Student.ID = Application.Student_ID;
